# SpiraTeam Google Sheets Integration Add-on
The web-based interface of SpiraTeam® is ideal for creating and managing requirements, test cases and incidents for a new project. However when migrating requirements, test cases, test steps and incidents for an existing project from another system, it is useful to be able to load in a batch of artifacts, rather than having to manually enter them one at a time.

To simplify this task  we’ve created a Google sheets add-on for SpiraTeam® that can export requirements, test cases, test steps and incidents from a generated spreadsheet into SpiraTeam®.

## Installation
The add-on runs using the Google App Script Engine so all of the files must be downloaded into a single file and run using Google App Script. [Google App Script Docs](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).

The easiest path is to simply create a new Google App Script project and import all of the downloaded files, then you may test the code in an IDE-like test environment.


## Usage
You must have a SpiraTeam® account with the proper permissions to utilize this app. For usage instructions reference the SpiraTeam® documentation located at [SpiraTeam® Product Add-ons and Downloads](https://www.inflectra.com/SpiraTest/Downloads.aspx#ImportTools).
